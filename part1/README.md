## :page_with_curl: **Part Description:**

This part was about basics of React.<br>

- The firt project **Course Info** is about creating a displaying system for courses, their exercises amounts and a total<br>
calculation of the course's exercises.

- The second project **Unicafe** is about creating a rating program, which simply workes by displaying the total ratings<br>
as well as buttons options to add a new rating.

- The last project **anecdote** is about generating random texts to display, and a button to randomly switch to the next<br>
text. As well as a button to vote on good texts.

## :bulb: **The idea behind the projects**

The concept was to learn the use of **Hooks** and **states**, how to render the website and update it's components without refreshing<br>
the whole website.
