## :page_with_curl: **Part Description:**

This part was mainly focused on learning how to use Redux to handle state management within a react-application.

## :bulb: **The idea behind the project**

- The first project **unicafe** was a fairly simple project of voting button program. The main concept was to get<br>
introduced to ``reducers``, how to use them and with using **deep freeze** for testing to make sure that states do not
get modified directly in anyway within the reducer.
- The second project **anecdotes** get deeper into using ``configureStore`` functions, using several reducers,<br>
using both (``useDispatch`` and ``useSelector``) and (``connect``) methods to handle states.
